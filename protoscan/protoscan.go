// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// BindProtofileSymbols loads the currently running executable in memory
// using Go's private objfile API and then loops over its symbols in order
// to find `protoFiles` variables.
// NOTE: since its an internal API, the objfile package and its dependencies
//       had to be fully copied into this project, see protoscan/internal/.
//
// These `protoFiles` variables are maintained by the various protobuf
// libraries out there (i.e. golang/protobuf, gogo/protobuf & other
// implementations) in order to keep track of the FileDescriptorProtos
// that have been loaded at boot-time (see proto.RegisterFile).
// This essentially means that each and every protobuf schema known
// by the currently running program is stored into these maps.
//
//
// There are two main issues that need to be worked around though:
//
// A. `proto.protoFiles` is a package-level private variable and, as such,
//    cannot be (to my knowledge at least) accessed by any means except
//    by forking the original package, which is not a viable option here.
//
// B. Because of how vendoring works, there can actually be an infinite amount
//    of `proto.protoFiles` variables instanciated at runtime, and we must
//    to get ahold of each and every one of them.
//
// Considering the above issues, doing some hacking with the symbols seem
// to be the smart(er) way to go here.
// As `proto.protoFiles` variables are declared as a package-level globals,
// their respective virtual addresses are known at compile-time and stored
// in the executable: what we're doing here is we find those addresses then
// apply some unsafe-foo magic in order to create local pointers that point
// to these addresses.
//
// And, voila!
