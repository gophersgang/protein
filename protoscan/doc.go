// Package protoscan provides the necessary tools & APIs to find, extract,
// version and build the dependency trees of all the protobuf schemas that
// have been instanciated by one or more protobuf library (golang/protobuf,

//
// This is a fairly low-level package, used to power the deeper innards of
// `protein`; as such, it should very rarely be of use to the end-user.
