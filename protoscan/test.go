// `TestSchema` and `DepsEntry` are both immutable, for-testing-purposes
// only schemas and, as such, both their respective single & recursive
// hashes can be known in advance and shouldn't ever change unless the
// `ByteSSlice.Hash` method is ever modified.
//
// If such a modification of `ByteSSlice.Hash`'s behavior were to happen,
// you'd have to modify the following expected values in order to fix the
// tests.. That is, if you're sure about what you're doing.
