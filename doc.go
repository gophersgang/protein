// Package protein is an encoding/decoding library for Protobuf that comes with
// schema-versioning and runtime-decoding capabilities.

//   - setting up schema registries
//   - decoding Protobuf payloads without the need to know their schema at
//     compile-time
//   - identifying & preventing applicative bugs and data corruption issues
//   - creating custom-made container formats for on-disk storage
//   - ...and more!
